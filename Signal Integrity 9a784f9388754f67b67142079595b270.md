# Signal Integrity

Signal integrity refers, in its broadest sense, to all the problems that arise in high-speed products due to the interconnects. It is about how the electrical properties of the interconnects, interacting with the digital signal‚Äôs voltage and current waveforms, can affect performance.

All of these problems fall into one of the following categories:

1. Timing:
    
    In one cycle of a clock, a certain number of operations must happen. This short amount of time must be divided up and allocated, in a budget, to all the various operations. For example, some time is allocated for gate switching, for propagating the signal to the output gate, for waiting for the clock to get to the next gate, and for waiting for the gate to read the data at the input. This book concentrates on the effects of the interconnects on the other generic high-speed problem, too much noise.
    
2. Noise:
    
    
3. Electromagnetic interference (EMI)

We hear about a lot of signal-integrity noise problems, such as ringing, ground bounce, reflections, near-end cross talk, switching noise, non-monotonicity, power bounce, attenuation, and capacitive loading. All of these relate to the electrical properties of the interconnects and how the electrical properties affect the waveforms of the digital signals.

All the effects listed here, associated with signal-integrity noise problems,
are related to one of the following four unique families of noise sources:

1. Signal quality of one net, including losses on the line. 
    
    Reflections and distortions from impedance discontinuities in the signal or return path.
    
2. Cross talk between two or more nets, including ground and power balance.
    
    Mutual C and mutual L coupling with ideal return paths and non-ideal return paths
    
3. Rail collapse in the power and ground distribution.
    
    Voltage drop across the impedance in the power/ground network.
    
4. Electromagnetic interference and radiation from the entire system.

Once we identify the root cause of the noise associated with each of these four families of problems, and understand the essential principles behind them, the general solution for finding and fixing the problems in each family will become obvious.

### 1. Signal quality of one net:

Signal quality on a single net depends as much on the physical features of the signal trace as on the return path. 

When the signal leaves the output driver, the voltage and the current, which make up the signal, see the interconnect as an electrical impedance. As the signal propagates down the net, it is constantly probing and asking, ‚Äúwhat is the instantaneous impedance I see?‚Äù If the impedance the signal sees stays the same, the signal continues undistorted. If, however, the impedance changes, the signal will reflect from the change and continue through the rest of the interconnect distorted. If there are enough impedance changes, the distortions can cause false triggering.

Any feature that changes the cross section or geometrical shape of the net will change the impedance the signal sees. We call any feature that changes the impedance a ***discontinuity***. Every discontinuity will cause the signal to be distorted from its original pristine shape, to some extent. For example, some of the features that would change the impedance the signal sees include the following:

1. A line-width change
2. A layer change through a via
3. A gap in return-path plane
4. A connector
5. A branch, tee, or stub
6. The end of a net

These impedance discontinuities can arise from the cross section, the topology of the routed traces, or the added components. The most common discontinuity is what happens at the end of a trace, which is usually either a high impedance open at the receiver or a low impedance at the output driver.

The way to minimize the problems associated with impedance changes is to keep the impedance the signal sees constant throughout the net.

This strategy is typically implemented by doing three things. 

First, use a board with constant, or ‚Äúcontrolled,‚Äù impedance traces. This usually means using uniform transmission lines. 

Second, use routing rules that allow the topology to maintain a constant impedance down the trace. 

Finally, use strategically placed resistors to manipulate the reflections and keep the received signals looking clean.

Figure 1-5 is an example of poor signal quality due to impedance changes in the same net and when a terminating resistor is used to manage the impedance changes. Often, what we think of as ‚Äúringing‚Äù is really due to reflections associated with impedance changes. 

Even with perfect terminations, the precise board layout can drastically affect signal quality. When a trace branches into two paths, the impedance at the junction changes and some signal will reflect back to the source while some will continue down the branches in a reduced and distorted form. By rerouting the trace to be a ***daisy chain***, the signal sees a constant impedance all down the path and the signal quality can be restored.

![Untitled](Signal%20Integrity%209a784f9388754f67b67142079595b270/Untitled%201.png)

The impact on a signal from any discontinuity depends on the rise time of the signal. As the rise time gets shorter, the magnitude of the distortion will increase. This means that a discontinuity that was not a problem in a 33-MHz design may be a problem in a 100-MHz design.

The higher the frequency and the shorter the rise time, the more important it is to keep the impedance the signal sees constant. One way of achieving this is by using controlled impedance interconnects even in the packages, such as with multilayer ball grid arrays (BGAs). When the packages do not use controlled impedance, such as with lead frames, it‚Äôs important to keep the leads short, such as by using chip-scale packages (CSPs).

There are two other aspects of signal quality associated with one net. **Frequency-dependent losses** in the line from the conductor and the dielectric
cause higher frequency signal components to be attenuated more than the lower frequency components. The end result is an increase in the rise time of the signal as it propagates. When this rise time degradation approaches the period of a single bit, the digital information will be distorted. This effect is called ***inter-symbol interference (ISI)*** and is a significant source of problems in high-speed serial links, in the 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps) and higher regime.

The third aspect of signal quality problems associated with a single net is related to **timing**. The time delay difference between two or more signal paths is called ***skew***. When a signal and clock line have a skew different than expected, false triggering and errors can result. When the skew is between the two lines that make up a differential pair, some of the differential signal will be converted into common signal and the differential signal will be distorted. This will result in ISI and false triggering. 

<aside>
üí° Skew is the time delay between two or more nets. It can be controlled to first order by matching the length of the nets. In addition, the local variation in dielectric constant between the nets will also affect the time delay and is more difficult to control.

</aside>

While skew is a timing problem, it often arises due to the electrical properties of the interconnect. The first order impact on skew is from the total length of the interconnects. This is easily controlled by careful layout to match lengths. However, the time delay is also related to the **local dielectric constant** each signal sees and is often a much more difficult problem to fix. 

### 2. Cross talk:

When one net carries a signal, some of this voltage and current can pass over to an adjacent quiet net, which is just sitting there, minding its own business. Even though the signal quality on the first net (the active net) is perfect, some of the signal can couple over and appear as unwanted noise on the second, quiet net. 

<aside>
üí° It is the capacitive and inductive coupling between two nets that provides a path for unwanted noise from one net to the other.

</aside>

Cross talk occurs in two different environments: 

when the interconnects are uniform transmission lines, as in most traces in a circuit board. 

And when they are not uniform transmission lines, as in connectors and packages.

In controlled impedance transmission lines where the traces have a wide uniform return path, the relative amount of capacitive coupling and inductive coupling is comparable.
In this case, these two effects combine in different ways at the near end of the quiet line and at the far end of the quiet line. An example of the measured near and far-end cross talk between two nets in a circuit board is shown in Figure 1-7.

![Untitled](Signal%20Integrity%209a784f9388754f67b67142079595b270/Untitled%202.png)

Having a wide uniform plane as the return path is the configuration of lowest cross talk. Anything that changes the return path from a wide uniform plane will increase the amount of coupled noise between two transmission lines. Usually when this happens, for example, when the signal goes through a connector and the return paths for more than one signal path are now shared by one of the pins rather than by a plane, the inductively coupled noise increases much more than the capacitively coupled noise. In this regime, where inductively coupled noise dominates, we usually refer to the cross talk as switching noise, delta I noise, dI-dt noise, ground bounce, simultaneous switching noise (SSN), or simultaneous switching output (SSO)
noise. This type of noise is generated by the coupled inductance, which is called mutual inductance. 

Switching noise occurs mostly in connectors, packages, and vias, where the return path conductor is not a wide, uniform plane.

An example of SSO noise from the high mutual inductance between adjacent signal and return paths in a package is shown in Figure 1-8.

SSO noise, where the coupled, or mutual inductance, dominates is becoming one of the most important issues in connector and package design. It will only get worse in next generation products. The solution lies in careful design of the geometry of paths so that mutual inductance is minimized, and in the use of differential signaling. 

By understanding the nature of the capacitive and inductive coupling, it is possible to optimize the physical design of the adjacent signal traces to minimize the coupling. This usually can be as simple as spacing the traces farther apart. In addition, the use of lower dielectric constant material will decrease the cross talk for the same characteristic impedance lines.

Some aspects of cross talk, especially switching noise, increase with the length of the interconnect and with decreasing rise time, it decreases the rise time because the signal is getting affected. Shorter rise-time signals will create more cross talk. Keeping interconnects short, such as by using Chip-scale packages (CSPs) and high-density interconnects (HDI), will help to minimize cross talk.

### 3. Rail-Collapse Noise:

When current through the power- and ground-path changes, as when a chip switches its outputs or core gates switch, there will be a voltage drop across the impedance of the power and ground paths. This voltage drop will mean less voltage gets to the chip, which will see a decrease, or collapse, of the voltage between the power and ground rails.

The transient current in a PDN creates two effects on the power rails: ground bounce and rail collapse. Rail collapse and ground bounce are two transient effects that have the same effects on power integrity, but they occur in different ways. 

In high-performance processors, FPGAs, and some ASICs, the trend is for lower power-supply voltage, but higher power consumption. This is primarily due to more gates on a chip switching faster. In each cycle, a certain amount of energy is consumed. When the chip switches faster, the same energy is consumed in each cycle, but consumed more often, leading to higher than average power consumption.

Anytime an electrical circuit or system changes state, there is a transient response as the system settles into a new steady state. Sometimes, a transient response in a system is so fast and smooth as to be unnoticeable. In other cases, the transient response appears as large fluctuations in signal levels, and a signal during this transition will be unrecognizable. A principle goal in¬†high-speed PCB design ¬†is to prevent unwanted transient behavior from affecting components, as well as to eliminate it altogether. Although a DC PDN in your PCB is supposed to only output DC power, it also exhibits a transient response when components switch states, and the transient response can affect the function of all other components connected to the PDN. Designers should understand the possible PDN transient current dynamics in order to find ways to keep power delivery stable in a PCB. As it turns out, there are some simple design choices designers can use to ensure stable power delivery.

<aside>
üí° The goal in designing the power and ground distribution is to try to minimize the impedance of the power-distribution system (PDS), sometimes also called the power delivery network (PDN). In this way, even though there is current switching in the PDN, the voltage
drop across a lower impedance may be kept to an acceptable level. The requirements for the impedance of the PDN have been evaluated for high-end processors by Sun Microsystems. Their estimate of the required impedance of the PDN is shown in Figure 1-10. Lower impedance in the PDN is increasingly important and harder to achieve.

</aside>

If we understand how the physical design of the interconnects affects their impedance, we can optimize the design of the PDN for low impedance.

Designing a low-impedance PDN means including features such as the following:

1. Closely spaced adjacent planes for the power and ground distribution with as thin a dielectric between them as possible, near the surface of the board.
2. Multiple, low-inductance decoupling capacitors.
3. Multiple, very short power and ground leads in packages.
4. On-chip decoupling capacitance.

An innovative technology to help minimize rail collapse can be seen in the new ultrathin, high-dielectric constant laminates for use between power and ground layers. One example is C-Ply from 3M Corp. This material is 8 microns thick and has a dielectric constant of 20. Used as the power and ground layers in an otherwise conventional board, the ultralow loop inductance and high distributed capacitance dramatically reduce the impedance of the power and ground distribution.

far-field strength from common currents

- **Dielectric constant or relative permittivity (Er or Dk):**
    
    Considering the dielectric constant of a material is important for signal integrity and impedance considerations, which are critical factors for high-frequency electrical performance. The Er for most PCB materials is in the range of 2.5 to 4.5. The dielectric constant varies with frequency and generally decreases as frequency increases; some materials have less of a change in relative permittivity than others. Substrates suitable for high-frequency applications are those whose dielectric constant remains relatively the same over a wide frequency range‚Äìfrom a few 100MHz to several GHz.
    **Low Dk PCB Materials:**
    When a signal propagates through a substrate, its dielectric constant alters the signal behavior. This is because the EM wave emitted is not conned to the trace and passes through the substrate. This can cause severe signal integrity issues. This effect will be even more signicant at high frequencies.
    The speed of the propagating EM wave is inversely proportional to the dielectric constant. Hence, a low Dk PCB material will have the following advantages: 
    
    - High-speed signals propagate with lower losses.
    - Reduced crosstalk between closely spaced traces and vias
    - Limits the need for capacitive coupling in the circuit
    - Lowers the adverse effect of mismatched trace lengths in parallel nets
    
    Even with all the advantages, the dispersion in the low Dk PCB material still exists, which can distort the digital signals. They are also more expensive than FR4. They may also need higher temperatures and pressure during the board fabrication process, which can drive the cost even higher. A few examples of high-speed materials include Rogers 4350B, RT Duroid 5880, and Isola-I speed.
    ********************************************High Dk PCB Materials:********************************************
    Even though we associate power integrity with constant voltage input, the dielectric constant also affects the stability of the input power. If you place a high Dk material between the power and ground layers, the interplanar capacitance will become signicant. The planes themselves act as a large decoupling capacitor which helps to maintain a constant input voltage. It also lowers the PDN impedance. However, a higher Dk will result in
    increased dielectric loss, crosstalk, and EMI issues. In order to balance power and signal integrity, it is advised to opt for a hybrid stack-up of high and low Dk PCB materials. A higher dielectric constant substrate can be used for separating the power and ground layer whereas the lower Dk substrate supports the signal layer with less loss. Manufacturing hybrid stack-ups depends on manufacturer capabilities as they have to consider the difference in CTE of the materials used.

### 4. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI):

With board-level clock frequencies in the 100-MHz to 500-MHz range, the first few harmonics are within the common communications bands of TV, FM radio, cell phone, and personal communications services (PCS). This means there is the very real possibility of electronic products interfering with communications unless their electromagnetic emissions are kept below acceptable levels.

It takes three things to have an EMI problem: a source of noise, a pathway to a radiator, and an antenna. 

> In the context of electromagnetic interference (EMI), a pathway to a radiator refers to any physical connection or conductive medium that allows the noise generated by the source to propagate and be emitted by an antenna or radiating element.
> 
> 
> In electronic circuits, the pathway to a radiator can be any type of conducting material or structure, such as wires, traces on a printed circuit board (PCB), metal enclosures, or connectors. If these conductive paths are not properly shielded or isolated, they can act as antennas that radiate the noise generated by the source and interfere with other electronic devices or systems.
> 
> To mitigate EMI problems caused by pathways to radiators, various techniques can be used, such as using shielded cables, grounding, filtering, and layout optimization. By reducing the coupling between the noise source and the antenna or radiating element, these techniques can help prevent the emission of unwanted electromagnetic radiation and ensure the proper functioning of electronic systems.
> 

Every source of signal-integrity problem mentioned above will be a source of EMI. What makes EMI so challenging is that even if the noise is low enough to meet the signal-integrity noise budget, it may still be large enough to cause serious radiated emissions.

## Two important generalizations:

Two important generalizations should be clear from looking at the four signal integrity problems above.

First, each of the four families of problems gets worse as rise times decrease. All the signal-integrity problems above scale with how fast the current changes or with how fast the voltage changes. This is often referred to as dI/dt or dV/dt. Shorter rise times mean higher dI/dt and dV/dt.

The second important generalization is that effective solutions to signal integrity problems are based heavily on understanding the impedance of interconnects. If we have a clear intuitive sense of impedance and can relate the physical design of the interconnects with their impedance, many signal-integrity problems can be eliminated during the design process.

## Simulations:

There are three types of electrical simulation tools that predict the analog effects
of the interconnects on signal behavior:

1. Electromagnetic (EM) simulators, which solve Maxwell‚Äôs Equations and
simulate the electric and magnetic fields at various locations in the time or
frequency domains
2. Circuit simulators, which solve the differential equations corresponding to
various circuit elements and include Kirchhoff‚Äôs current and voltage relationships
to predict the voltages and currents at various circuit nodes, in the
time or frequency domains
3. Behavioral simulators, which use models based on tables and transmission
lines and other passive-element models based on transfer functions, which
quickly predict the voltages and currents at various nodes, typically in the
time domain
